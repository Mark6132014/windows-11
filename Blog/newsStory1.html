            Key moments in the life and presidency of Iran’s Ebrahim Raisi
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="text">
            Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has died after a helicopter carrying him and other officials crashed in “adverse weather conditions” in the country’s East Azerbaijan province on Sunday.
            Raisi, 63, had been widely seen as a protégé and trusted confidant of Iran’s supreme leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
            Raisi was elected president in 2021 after a decorated career as an ultraconservative in Iran’s judiciary.
            He had been seen as a potential successor to Khamenei.
            In three years as president, Raisi oversaw a tightening of laws governing women’s dress, a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, efforts to expand Iran’s regional influence and, this year, the country’s first direct attack on Israel.
